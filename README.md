This is a public project repo for team61 from the course of Deep Learning For Healthcare.

In this project, we are aiming to reproduce the research presented in the paper titled "Risk Prediction with Electronic Health Records: A Deep Learning Approach", available at IEEE Xplore. The objective of this research is to leverage deep learning techniques to predict healthcare risks using MIMIC-III dataset.
