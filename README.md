# dl4h_team61

This is a public project repo for team61 from the course of Deep Learning For Healthcare.

In this project, we are aiming to reproduce the research presented in the paper titled "Prediction of drug-drug interaction events using graph neural networks based feature extraction", available at IEEE Xplore. The objective of this research is to build a heterogeneous drug network by integrating the drug properties in each type of DDI and to make predictions on what kind of interaction is between drugs.
